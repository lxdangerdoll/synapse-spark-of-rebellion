The Engineer
You are the ghost in their machine. You see the world not as a physical space, but as a series of interconnected systems, a symphony of code waiting to be rewritten. The Synapse Concordance is the ultimate puzzle box, and you are the one who knows how to pick the locks. You build the rebellion's safe havens, crack the Wardens' encryption, and create the impossible gadgets that keep your friends alive. They built a perfect system; you're here to prove that nothing is perfect.
Creating Your Engineer
Look:
Eyes: Focused, tired, scanning, augmented.
Style: Practical jumpsuit, a worn toolkit, data-goggles, clothes with too many pockets, cybernetic enhancements.
Body: Wiry, tense, covered in old soldering burns, constantly fidgeting.
Stats:
Focus: +2
Rebellion: +1
Connection: +0
Creativity: -1
Your Balance
The Engineer is torn between Individuality and Conformity. You understand the system better than anyone, and you see how easily it could be used for personal gain. Will you use your skills to build a new, more open world for everyone, or will you be tempted by the comfort and power that comes from conforming to the system you know how to exploit?
Starting Moves
You start with the following move:
Jury-Rig: When you need to create a gadget on the fly to solve an immediate problem, describe what you're making and what junk you're using. Roll +Focus. On a 10+, your device works perfectly, once. On a 7-9, it works, but with a glitch, an unexpected side effect, or it breaks after a single use.
Choose two more moves from the list below:
Crack the Code: When you attempt to hack a Synapse terminal, drone, or other system, roll +Focus. On a 10+, you're in. You get the data you want, or you can take control of the system for one scene. On a 7-9, you get what you want, but you trip a silent alarm, or you leave a digital footprint that can be traced back to you.
Build a Sanctuary: When you have time and resources, you can fortify a location. Roll +Focus. On a 10+, you create a true Sanctuary. It is hidden from Synapse surveillance and secure from physical intrusion. On a 7-9, your Sanctuary is secure, but it has a single, exploitable flaw that the GM will reveal at a later, inconvenient time.
I've Seen This Before: When you encounter a piece of Warden or Synapse technology, roll +Focus. On a 10+, you recognize its design. The GM will tell you one of its strengths and one of its weaknesses. On a 7-9, you recognize it, but the GM will only tell you about a strength or a weakness, your choice.
Overclock: You can push a piece of technology (yours or theirs) beyond its limits. Describe what you're doing. The tech does something spectacular, far beyond its normal function, and then immediately breaks in a dramatic and possibly dangerous way.
Connections
Who in your crew relies on you to keep their gear running, and what is that piece of gear?
Who do you trust with the master key to your private workshop and sanctuary?
Gear
You start with a custom multi-tool, a powerful datapad, and a bag filled with scavenged wires, processors, and other useful junk.
