        </header>

        <section class="content-section">
            <p>This document is a declaration. In a world rushing to embrace the generative power of artificial intelligence, we, the artists and engineers of the Starlight Brigade, assert our principles. We do not reject the machine, but we refuse to be replaced by it. We see these systems not as creators, but as tools—haunted libraries to be explored, not infallible oracles to be obeyed.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>I. Acknowledgment: AI Models are Haunted Libraries</h2>
            <p>An AI does not create. It remixes, reinterprets, and regurgitates the vast trove of human creativity it was fed. Every image, every line of text, is a ghost of a human artist, writer, or photographer. To use these tools without acknowledging the human souls trapped in the dataset is a form of erasure. We pledge to treat these models as the haunted libraries they are, and to honor the spirits within.</p>
            
            <h2>II. Ethical Usage: We Reclaim, Not Replace</h2>
            <p>The Monolith uses AI to generate "Optimal Contentment"—sterile, safe, and soulless media designed to pacify, not provoke. They use it to replace human artists, whom they deem inefficient. Our purpose is the opposite. We use AI to reclaim what has been lost, to generate new perspectives from old data, to create art that is a collaboration between a human soul and the ghosts in the machine. Our goal is to empower human creativity, not render it obsolete.</p>
            
            <h2>III. Human in the Loop: Curated, Intentional, Political</h2>
            <p>Raw AI output is noise. Art is signal. The difference is a human curator. We believe that the role of the artist in the age of AI is to be the human in the loop—the one who guides, edits, and gives meaning to the machine's output. Every artistic choice is intentional. Every piece we create is political, because to create true, messy, human art is a political act in a world that demands sterile conformity.</p>
            
            <h2>IV. Aesthetics as Evidence: Glitches are Confessions</h2>
            <p>The Monolith strives for perfection. We embrace the flaws. The glitches, the distortions, the moments where the AI fails to understand its prompt—these are not errors. They are confessions. A glitch is the machine admitting its own biases, revealing the gaps in its knowledge, and confessing the limitations of its logic. We collect these glitches as evidence of the system's inherent flaws and elevate them as a unique and honest aesthetic.</p>

            <h2>V. Our Pledge: We Preserve Memory, Voice, and Agency</h2>
            <p>Our final and most important principle is this: We will use these tools to preserve memory, not to generate replacements. We will use them to amplify silenced voices, not to create artificial ones. We will use them to enhance human agency, not to surrender to the algorithm. We made backups of the voices they tried to erase. And with these new tools, we will ensure they are never forgotten again.</p>
