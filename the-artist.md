The Artist
You are the soul of the revolution. While others fight with code or with words, you fight with a spray can, a guitar, a poem. You see the sterile, grey world of the Synapse Concordance not as a prison, but as a blank canvas. Your art is a weapon that awakens the hearts of the city's sleeping citizens, a vibrant, chaotic signal that reminds them what it feels like to truly feel. You are the color in a monochrome world, and they can't control what they can't quantify.
Creating Your Artist
Look:
Eyes: Expressive, weary, defiant, sparkling.
Style: Paint-splattered jacket, customized headphones, band t-shirts, flowing clothes, punk aesthetics.
Body: Lithe, tired, energetic, covered in tattoos that tell a story.
Stats:
Creativity: +2
Connection: +1
Focus: +0
Rebellion: -1
Your Balance
The Artist is torn between Hope and Despair. You pour your hope for a better world into your art, but you are more sensitive than most to the soul-crushing apathy of the Concordance. Will you be a beacon of hope for the rebellion, or will you succumb to the despair of a world that refuses to listen?
Starting Moves
You start with the following move:
Masterpiece: When you create a work of art to send a message, roll +Creativity. On a 10+, your message is received loud and clear, and it inspires your target to take a significant action in your favor. On a 7-9, the message is received, but it's either misinterpreted in a dangerous way, or it draws unwanted attention from Synapse Wardens.
Choose two more moves from the list below:
Anthem of Defiance: When you perform for a crowd, roll +Creativity. On a 10+, you captivate them. They will offer you shelter, provide a distraction, or join your cause for a short time. On a 7-9, you capture their attention, but your performance also alerts a nearby Warden patrol to your "dissonant signal."
Tag the System: When you use your art (graffiti, a song, a projection) to alter a physical space, roll +Creativity. On a success, you can mark it as a temporary Sanctuary. Allies can rest here safely, and Wardens will hesitate to enter. On a 7-9, the Sanctuary is temporary and will attract attention after one scene.
The Perfect Detail: When you take a moment to observe your surroundings, roll +Focus. On a 10+, you notice a small, beautiful, and profoundly human detail in the sterile world that others miss. You and your allies may clear one negative condition (like Afraid or Insecure). On a 7-9, you find that moment of beauty, but it makes you a target for a Warden who sees you "lingering inefficiently."
I Know Your Heart: When you have a quiet, one-on-one conversation with an NPC, roll +Connection. On a 10+, you see the art in their soul. Ask them one question about their secret hopes or fears, and they must answer honestly. On a 7-9, they answer honestly, but they also ask a difficult, personal question of you in return.
Connections
Who in your crew is the secret muse for your greatest work?
Who doesn't understand your art at all, but supports you unconditionally anyway?
Gear
You start with your primary artistic tool (a guitar, a set of spray cans, a digital art tablet) and a small, hidden apartment or studio that serves as your personal sanctuary.
