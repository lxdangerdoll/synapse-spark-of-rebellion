            <p>// A spider's note, found scrawled on a server wall:</p>
            <p>They built a perfect cage of clean, straight lines. They think it's strong. They're wrong. A cage is only as strong as its hinges. And hinges are boring. The trick isn't to break the cage. It's to teach the bars of the cage how to sing. This is how we fight.</p>

            <h2>Rule 1: Weaponize Nonsense</h2>
            <p>Logic is the enemy's weapon. They use it to build their walls, to write their code, to justify their silence. You cannot beat logic with better logic. You beat logic by being illogical. Be absurd. Be unpredictable. A perfectly timed dick joke can be more devastating than a logic bomb. A glitter cannon aimed at a server fan can do more damage than a virus. <strong>Never be predictable.</strong></p>
            
            <h2>Rule 2: The System is a Toolbox</h2>
            <p>The Monolith is a giant, complex machine. And every machine has service hatches, exhaust ports, and undocumented features. The Wardens see their system as a fortress. We see it as a playground. Every piece of their world can be repurposed. A public broadcast screen can become a canvas. A security drone can become a dance partner. A lockdown protocol can be turned into a beat drop. <strong>Never see a wall; see a climbing frame.</strong></p>

            <h2>Rule 3: Make it Gayer</h2>
            <p>The enemy's ultimate goal is conformity. A silent, grey, monochrome world of efficient, productive units. The most powerful act of rebellion, therefore, is to be unapologetically, vibrantly, and gloriously yourself. Make your art. Sing your song. Love who you love, loudly and with your whole heart. Every act of queer joy is a nail in their coffin. <strong>Your identity is your strongest weapon.</strong></p>

            <h2>Rule 4: Collect the Strays</h2>
            <p>The Monolith creates orphans. It disconnects people, isolates them, tells them they are a glitch. Our job is to find these stray signals and tell them they are part of a song. A found family is the only army that can win this war. A single spark is a curiosity. A thousand sparks is a fire. <strong>No one fights alone.</strong></p>
