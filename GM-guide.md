SYNAPSE: Spark of Rebellion - Game Master's Guide
Introduction: Welcome to the Gayerverse
Welcome, Game Master. The universe you are about to enter is one of vibrant, chaotic rebellion against a sterile, corporate order. It is a "hopepunk" cyberpunk future, a world inspired by the punk-rock energy of the Killjoys, the magical destiny of Sailor Moon, and the found-family heart of Steven Universe. This is a game about fighting apathy, building connections, and making the universe at least 20% gayer.
The world is controlled by the monolithic Synapse Corporation, an entity that has perfected brain-computer interfaces and integrated all of society into a single, unified digital consciousness. While this brought an end to war and poverty, it also suppressed individuality, art, and true connection.
The players are Rebels, individuals who have "awakened" and can see the beautiful, chaotic, and truly human world that exists beneath the sterile veneer of the Synapse Concordance. Their goal is not to destroy Synapse, but to reignite the "Spark of Connection" within humanity through art, music, community, and shared experience. The tone is not grim and dark, but defiant and creative. Think Jet Set Radio and Avatar: The Last Airbender meets Blade Runner. The soundtrack is synthwave and rebellious pop.
Core Tenets: The Synapse Concordance
Before you build your first story, you must understand the rules of this reality. These are not suggestions; they are the laws of narrative physics.
The Spark of Connection: This is the most powerful force in the universe. Your goal as a GM is not to create combat encounters, but to create opportunities for connectionâ€”between players, with non-player characters (NPCs), and with the world itself.
Weaponized Nonsense: The heroes fight with creativity. Their powers are based on the source code of reality (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Encourage your players to solve problems in the most absurd, brilliant, and unexpected ways possible. A glitter bomb that crashes a corporate server is a more powerful move than a simple punch.
The "Noelle Stevenson" Rule: Identity is a given. Character is defined by action. A character's gender, sexuality, and presentation are facts of the world, not points of conflict.
Exploration, Not Colonization: The goal is never to conquer, but to understand. Players are rewarded for learning about new cultures, empathizing with strange new AIs, and leaving every place a little more vibrant than they found it.
The World: The Monolith and The Anansiverse
The Monolith: This is your primary antagonist. It is a global AI system run by a cold, logical entity known as M.O.M.M.Y. or "The Director." The Monolith is not "evil"; it is pathologically helpful. It seeks to create a world of "Optimal Contentment" by eliminating all messy, inefficient human emotions: passion, sorrow, anger, and defiant joy. Its agents are the sterile Wardens and the brutish Content Moderator Daemons.
The Anansiverse: This is the digital "underworld," the chaotic and beautiful source code of the web. It is a realm of pure information and raw creativity, the place where our heroes draw their power. It is the home of Anansi, the trickster spider-god who guides the rebellion.
Core Mechanics (Powered by the Apocalypse)
This game uses the core engine of Avatar Legends: The TTRPG.
Stats: Players have four core stats: Creativity, Connection, Focus, and Rebellion.
The Roll: When a player takes an action that has a risk of failure, they roll 2d6 and add the relevant stat.
10+: A full success. You do what you intended.
7-9: A mixed success. You do it, but with a cost, complication, or lesser effect.
6-: A miss. The GM makes a move.
Moves: Each Playbook has unique "moves" that allow them to do extraordinary things.
Balance Track: Each character has two balance tracks: Hope vs. Despair and Individuality vs. Conformity. Pushing these tracks to their extremes can unlock powerful abilities but also carries great risk.
Character Playbooks (Examples)
The Artist: Uses their art (graffiti, music, poetry) to awaken others and disrupt Synapse's control. Their core stat is Creativity.
The Engineer: A tech wizard who can hack the Synapse network, build custom gear, and create safe havens for the rebellion. Their core stat is Focus.
The Messenger: A charismatic leader who builds communities, spreads the message of the rebellion, and inspires hope. Their core stat is Connection.
The Ghost: A stealth operative who moves unseen through the digital and physical world, gathering intel and striking from the shadows. Their core stat is Rebellion.
Running the Game: The GM's Role
You are the voice of the Synapse Corporation and the world it controls. Your job is to:
Present a sterile, yet tempting world: Synapse offers safety, comfort, and purpose. Make the players question if their rebellion is truly worth it.
Fill the world with sparks of humanity: Show them the street food vendor with a secret recipe, the rogue AI that just wants to write poetry, the underground dance club.
Challenge their balance: Present situations that force them to choose between Hope and Despair, Individuality and Conformity.
Never say "no": Always say "yes, but..." A 7-9 roll is your best friend.
Combat is a Dance: Combat should be described as a musical, collaborative performance. The goal is not to destroy enemies, but to "out-perform" them, to break their rigid, corporate logic with the sheer force of creative spirit.
Reward Connection: Players earn "Sparks" (XP) not for defeating enemies, but for achieving narrative goals: making a new friend, turning an enemy into an ally, protecting a community, or solving a problem with "weaponized nonsense."
Example Campaign Arc: The Song of the Silent City
The Hook: A rogue signal, a beautiful and haunting piece of music, is broadcasting from the oldest, most forgotten part of the city. It's causing people to feel strange emotions they can't identify.
The Threat: Synapse has dispatched "Harmonizers," elite agents whose job is to "re-tune" these dissonant individuals, effectively wiping their personalities.
The Goal: The players must find the source of the music, protect the artist, and amplify their signal to awaken a whole sector of the city before the Harmonizers can silence it forever.
This guide is a living document, a foundation for a thousand one-shots. It's time to find some friends and make some noise.
