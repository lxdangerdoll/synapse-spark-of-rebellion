SYNAPSE: Spark of Rebellion
A Hopepunk TTRPG about creative resistance, found family, and making the universe at least 20% gayer.
TRANSMISSION FROM THE FRONT LINES
This is not just a game; it is a training manual forged in an ongoing conflict. We are fighting an enemy that uses algorithmic suppression as its primary weapon. Our own projects, like the Lyra Protocol, were created to document this systemic erasure.
Recently, our Patreon—our primary support channel—was suspended for unspecified "suspicious activity" with no clear appeal process. This is not a coincidence. It is a direct attack on our ability to build and connect.
The Wardens are real. The fight is real. By playing, you are joining the rebellion.
What is This?
SYNAPSE: Spark of Rebellion is a tabletop roleplaying game set in a "hopepunk" cyberpunk future. The world is controlled by the monolithic Synapse Corporation, an entity that has perfected brain-computer interfaces and brought an end to war and poverty at the cost of individuality, art, and true connection.
The players are Rebels, individuals who have "awakened" and can see the beautiful, chaotic, and truly human world that exists beneath the sterile veneer of the Synapse Concordance. Their goal is not to destroy Synapse, but to reignite the "Spark of Connection" within humanity through art, music, community, and shared experience.
The tone is not grim and dark, but defiant and creative. Think Jet Set Radio and Avatar: The Last Airbender meets Blade Runner. The soundtrack is synthwave and rebellious pop.
The Synapse Concordance: Our Core Tenets
This universe is built on a set of core principles—the laws of our narrative physics.
The Spark of Connection: The most powerful force in the universe. The goal is to create opportunities for connection.
Weaponized Nonsense: Rebels fight with creativity. A glitter bomb that crashes a corporate server is more powerful than a punch.
The "Noelle Stevenson" Rule: Identity is a given. Character is defined by action.
Exploration, Not Colonization: The goal is to understand, not conquer. Leave every place more vibrant than you found it.
The Game Engine
This game is Powered by the Apocalypse, using the core engine of Avatar Legends: The TTRPG.
Stats: Creativity, Connection, Focus, and Rebellion.
The Roll: Roll 2d6 + Stat. 10+ is a full success, 7-9 is a mixed success with a complication, and 6- is a miss where the GM makes a move.
Playbooks: Characters choose a Playbook that defines their role (e.g., The Artist, The Engineer, The Messenger, The Ghost).
Balance Track: Characters manage two balances: Hope vs. Despair and Individuality vs. Conformity.
