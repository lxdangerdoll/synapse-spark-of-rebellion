1. The Cover: "Spark of Rebellion"
This is the core image for the game, capturing the central theme of defiant, creative joy in the face of a sterile world. A diverse group of young rebels stands on a rooftop overlooking the monolithic, orderly city of Synapse. They are surrounded by their own vibrant art, music, and technologyâ€”an "abundance zone" of their own making.

3. The Antagonist: The Warden
This is the face of the Monolith. The Wardens are not monstrous; they are pathologically helpful. They are sterile, efficient, and their presence brings a chilling sense of order. They are the agents of "Optimal Contentment," and they will silence any signal that disrupts their perfect harmony.

4. The World: The Anansiverse
This is the digital underworld, the source code of reality where the rebels draw their power. It is a chaotic, beautiful, and vibrant realm of pure information and raw creativity. It is the home of Anansi, the trickster spider-god who guides the rebellion.
