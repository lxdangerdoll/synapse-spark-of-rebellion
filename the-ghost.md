The Ghost
You are the whisper in the static. While others fight on the front lines with art or with words, you fight from the shadows. You move through the city's digital and physical spaces unseen, a phantom gathering the secrets the Monolith tries to bury. You are the one who gets into the places no one else can, the one who retrieves the data, the one who strikes the precise, surgical blow that can bring a system to its knees. You are a blade of pure, defiant will, and the Wardens can't catch what they can't see.
Creating Your Ghost
Look:
Eyes: Watchful, calculating, hidden, sharp.
Style: Dark, practical clothing with no logos, a hood or a mask, lightweight gear, clothes that blend into any crowd.
Body: Agile, quiet, disciplined, always poised for action.
Stats:
Rebellion: +2
Focus: +1
Creativity: +0
Connection: -1
Your Balance
The Ghost is torn between Individuality and Conformity. You are a weapon, a tool of the rebellion. You sacrifice your own identity for the sake of the mission, becoming whatever you need to be to get the job done. Will you hold onto the person you are beneath the mask, or will you conform completely to your role and become nothing more than a ghost, a function of the rebellion?
Starting Moves
You start with the following move:
Fade into the Static: When you want to become unseen, either in a physical crowd or a digital network, roll +Rebellion. On a 10+, you vanish completely. You can move freely without being detected for one scene. On a 7-9, you become unseen, but you must either leave something important behind or you can't stay hidden for long.
Choose two more moves from the list below:
Strike from the Shadows: When you attack an enemy from a position of stealth, roll +Rebellion. On a 10+, you deal a decisive blow. You can choose to either neutralize your target non-lethally or create a major, chaotic distraction. On a 7-9, you strike your target, but you are immediately exposed and lose your position of stealth.
Plant a Seed of Doubt: When you have access to a Warden or a corporate agent's personal files or communications, you can leave a subtle, anonymous message. Roll +Rebellion. On a success, you plant a seed of doubt in their mind. The next time you encounter them, they will hesitate at a critical moment. On a 7-9, your message also leaves a trace that could lead them to investigate you.
Infiltrator: When you try to bypass a security system (a lock, a laser grid, a firewall), roll +Focus. On a 10+, you get through cleanly and without a trace. On a 7-9, you get through, but you must either leave something behind, take something with you, or disable the security system in a loud and obvious way.
I Know Their Secrets: You've been watching. Once per session, you can ask the GM one question about the security, layout, or personnel of a location you are about to infiltrate. The GM must answer honestly.
Connections
Who in your crew is the only person who has seen your real face?
Who did you pull out of a tight spot without them ever knowing you were there?
Gear
You start with a set of dark, unmarked clothes, a data-knife for hacking terminals, and a choice of either a limited-use personal cloaking device or a set of advanced digital and analog lockpicks.
