The Messenger
You are the voice of the rebellion. You know that a revolution isn't won with weapons or code, but with people. You are a charismatic leader, a community builder, a beacon of hope in a world that has forgotten how to connect. You see the lonely, the disconnected, the forgotten, and you remind them that they are not alone. You spread the "Spark of Connection" like a wildfire, turning isolated individuals into a unified, unstoppable force.

Your Balance
The Messenger is torn between Hope and Despair. You are the heart of the movement, the one who carries the hopes and dreams of the entire rebellion on your shoulders. This gives you great strength, but the weight of it can be crushing. Will you be the unwavering beacon of hope your community needs, or will you crumble under the pressure of their expectations?
Starting Moves
You start with the following move:
Rally the Crowd: When you give an impassioned speech to a group of civilians, roll +Connection. On a 10+, your words ignite a fire in their hearts. They will rise up, creating a major distraction, providing cover for your escape, or joining you in a protest. On a 7-9, you inspire them, but your control is tenuous. They might get scared and flee, or their actions might be more chaotic and dangerous than you intended.
Choose two more moves from the list below:
The Right Words: When you try to defuse a tense, potentially violent situation with words, roll +Connection. On a 10+, you calm the situation completely. Tensions are lowered, and you have created an opening for a peaceful resolution. On a 7-9, you prevent immediate violence, but the situation is still unstable. You've bought yourself a few moments, but the threat remains.
Find a Friend in the System: When you are in a Warden-controlled area, you can try to find a sympathetic ear. Roll +Connection. On a 10+, you find an NPC who is secretly disillusioned with Synapse. They will provide you with a piece of intel, a keycard, or look the other way at a critical moment. On a 7-9, you find someone who is willing to help, but they will ask for a difficult and dangerous favor in return.
Whisper Network: You have a network of contacts and allies throughout the city. When you need to get a message out or find a piece of information, roll +Connection. On a 10+, your network provides exactly what you need quickly and discreetly. On a 7-9, the information is incomplete, garbled, or it takes a dangerously long time to arrive.
I See the Good in You: When you have a private conversation with a hostile NPC (not a Warden), you can try to connect with their humanity. Roll +Connection. On a 10+, you find the spark. They will have a moment of doubt, lower their weapon, or reveal a vulnerability. On a 7-9, you see the good in them, but it only makes them angrier and more defensive.
Connections
Who in your crew did you personally recruit into the Starlight Brigade, and what was their life like before they met you?
Whose trust did you have to work the hardest to earn?
Gear
You start with a set of stylish, memorable clothes, a hidden holographic projector for broadcasting your messages, and a satchel full of zines, pamphlets, and other revolutionary literature.
