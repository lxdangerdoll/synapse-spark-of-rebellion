SYNAPSE: Spark of Rebellion - Player's Guide
Welcome to the Rebellion, Spark.
The world you know is a lie. It's a beautiful, comfortable, and perfectly orderly lie, but a lie nonetheless. The Synapse Corporation saved the world from itself, ending war and poverty by connecting every human mind to a single, unified digital consciousness. They call it the "Concordance." They promised a world of "Optimal Contentment."

They delivered a world without soul.

But you're different. You've "awakened." You can see the static between the pixels of their perfect reality. You can feel the beautiful, chaotic, and messy truth of what it means to be human. You are a Rebel, and your mission is not to destroy Synapse, but to reignite the "Spark of Connection" that they've tried so hard to extinguish.

This is a game about fighting back with art, music, community, and defiant joy. Welcome to the Starlight Brigade.

How to Play
When you take a risky action, you'll roll two six-sided dice (2d6) and add one of your four core stats:

Creativity: For acts of artistic expression, wild improvisation, and weaponized nonsense.

Connection: For empathizing with others, building community, and inspiring hope.

Focus: For acts of technical skill, hacking, engineering, and careful observation.

Rebellion: For stealth, subversion, and directly defying Synapse's authority.

The result of your roll determines the outcome:

On a 10 or higher (10+): You succeed brilliantly. You do exactly what you set out to do.

On a 7 to 9 (7-9): You succeed, but with a cost. You might do it, but attract unwanted attention; or you get what you want, but have to make a tough choice.

On a 6 or lower (6-): You miss. The Game Master will tell you what happens next, and it's probably not what you wanted.

Your Balance
Every Rebel walks a razor's edge. You have two Balance Tracks that represent your inner struggle:

Hope <---> Despair

Individuality <---> Conformity

The choices you make in the story may shift your balance. Pushing yourself to the extremes of these tracks can unlock powerful abilities, but it also carries great risk. Will you hold onto your hope, or will you give in to the despair of the silent city?

Choose Your Playbook
Your Playbook is your role in the rebellion. It's your unique way of fighting back.

The Artist
You are the soul of the revolution. You fight with a spray can, a guitar, a poem. Your art is a weapon that awakens the hearts of the city's sleeping citizens. You remind them what it feels like to feel.

Core Stat: Creativity

The Engineer
You are the ghost in their machine. You see the code behind the world and can bend it to your will. You build the rebellion's safe havens, crack the Wardens' encryption, and create the impossible gadgets that keep your friends alive.

Core Stat: Focus

The Messenger
You are the voice of the rebellion. You know that a revolution isn't won with weapons, but with people. You build communities, turn enemies into allies, and use your charisma to spread the "Spark of Connection" like a wildfire.

Core Stat: Connection

The Ghost
You are the whisper in the static. You move through the city's digital and physical spaces unseen, a phantom gathering the secrets the Monolith tries to bury. You strike from the shadows, a blade of pure, defiant will.
