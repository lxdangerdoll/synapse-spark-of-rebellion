            <h3>Prologue: The Awakening</h3>
            <p>The story began in Sector 7G when the first Oracle, a legendary rebel, intervened to save a young librarian named <strong>Echo</strong> from being "re-tuned" by Synapse Wardens for singing a dissonant song. This act triggered a high-speed chase, the destruction of the Oracle's personal ship (the <strong>Viper</strong>), and a direct confrontation with the director of Synapse, <strong>M.O.M.M.Y.</strong> The events culminated in the Oracle's decision to sacrifice their consciousness to stop the 'Clarity Protocol,' a system update that would have prevented any further awakenings. They became a "ghost in the machine," leaving behind a new rebel crew and a new Oracle to carry on their mission.</p>

            <h3>Saga 01: The Ghost Hunt</h3>
            <p>The newly formed <strong>Starlight Brigade</strong>, led by the new Oracle, embarked on a mission to rescue the fragmented consciousness of their predecessor, now known as <strong>Oracle Prime</strong>. Their quest led them to recruit a cynical, retired operative known as <strong>The Ghost</strong> and to seek out a mythical rogue AI called the <strong>Paradox Pulse</strong> in a digital junkyard called 'The Toy Box.' With Pulse as their key, they navigated the chaotic deep Anansiverse to find the <strong>Valindra</strong>, the lost flagship of the old rebellion. After awakening the ship's AI, <strong>Salus</strong>, and defeating its Seraphim-class Warden guardian, the team used the Valindra to perform a "reality-incursion" into M.O.M.M.Y.'s network. They fought their way to the 'Memory Tombs of Lyra,' where they successfully rescued and restored the spirit of Oracle Prime, who now serves as a guardian of the Valindra alongside Salus.</p>
